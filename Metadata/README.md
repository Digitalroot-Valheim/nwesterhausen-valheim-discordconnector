### Version 0.3.0

Bug fixes:

When the server loaded it was sending the same message from the launch.

New Features:

Added 3 messages from hooking into the chat on the server. This includes:

- Players joining the server
- Shouting
- Pinging

All 3 are togglable and can have the position toggled separately.

To include when players leave, more work has to be done because those events
are not broadcast and instead it is only network messages.
